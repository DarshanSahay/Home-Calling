# Home-Calling

## A Hack and Slash Adventure Game made in Unity.

- The Game features Two Playable Characters.

- For the Time Being I have Implemented State Behavior for Enemies and Animation Events to Handle Character.

- I am working on Adding Design patterns like Observer and Singleton to make the game more Scalable.
